Ingredients:

- Provolone Cheese (or whatever cheese you like with your Turkey)
- Bread (2 slices of bread for a sandwhich)
- Italian Dressing (Zesty!)

Directions:
1. Heat up the Turkey in a hot skillet (heated to med-high for a few minutes).
2. Put Italian dressing on your bread (one or both sides, whichever you prefer).
3. Put Turkey on bread, then place dressing-side down onto the skillet.
4. Place cheese on top of Turkey, and the final slice of bread on last.
5. Flip the sandwhich once it is golden brown (or whatever color your prefer).
6. Put onto a plate once the final side is browned to your liking.
